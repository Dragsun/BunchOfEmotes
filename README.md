# Bunch Of Emotes

## introduction:
Bunch of Emotes is a menu that will allow you to use severall animation from the game, or even import your own !<br/>
Bunch of Emotes have 3 kind of menus :
- **the base emotes from the game, default values**
- **the base emotes from the game, custom values**
- **the custom emotes, aka default dance ect...**

All the animations should be synced over multiplayer and every keybind can be changed through the R2modman config editor.<br/>

**⚠ The animations has to be done while on foot, not when having the skateboard, BMX or the blades out it might not play the animation.** 
<br/>

---------------

## 1- the base emotes from the game, default values

To use this one simply press down the `N` button and select any of the available emotes with `left bracket '['` or `right bracket'['`. <br/>
Then press `N` again to play the selected emote, move or jump to go back to your normal state.<br/><br/>

## 2- the base emotes from the game, custom values

This one works in the same way and replaces the default list with emotes (still from the game) that you picked out from [the list](https://github.com/Dragsun/BunchOfEmotes/blob/main/ressources/list.txt). You then just have to follow the next how to.

How to make your own list of emotes (from the game):
Firstly you will have to navigate to the config files and switch the `Do you want to use a custom list ?` to `true`.<br/>
Secondly you need to make a list separated by `,` with the emote names that are [listed here](https://github.com/Dragsun/BunchOfEmotes/blob/main/ressources/list.txt). The list is case sensitive, and requires no spaces.<br/>

Example : `jumpNEW,fallNEW,wallRunLeftNEW,grafSlashUP_RIGHT`<br/>

If you have [BepInEx.ConfigurationManager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/tree/master) you can change all of it without having to reboot the game. 

*Not all the animations has been tested, since those are from the game. So it's possible that some will not work and just make you sit, if this is the case please verify if the word is written correctly, and if you did the animation on foot.*<br/><br/>

## 3- Making your own list of emotes (external from the game):
[Refer to this page](https://github.com/Dragsun/BunchOfEmotes/wiki/Create-your-own-animation-pack-!)

### Using your custom list of emotes
By pressing the `B` button you can switch between the in game emotes and the custom ones and use the regular keybinds to navigate through! Slecting and chosing them are still the same.
